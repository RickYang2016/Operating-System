# Operating-System
1. The sum.cpp can read a text file, and compute the sum of all numbers included in the file. When you run the sum.cpp file, you can use the flag -i to add the input file. If you want to save the result, use the flag -o and the result will automatically save in the file nameing 'output_part1'.

2. The rbf.cpp can read a binary file and write to an ASCII text file. our code must follow the command-line format:

            ./a.out input_file_name output_file_name
            
where the input file named input file name is a binary file, and the output file is an ASCII text file.
